# Free-fall Model Calculator
Calculates values of acceleration, velocity and distance of a free falling object - with air resistance

Using the formula: 

a = (W - D) / m 
- Where a is acceleration, W is weight, D is drag and m is mass

The program calculates the acceleration, velocity and distance at different time intervals specified by the user; and then outputs the results to a "output.txt".
